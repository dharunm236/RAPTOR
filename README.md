PROJECT RAPTOR
-This is a simulation of a stock exchange platform implemented using basic networking protocols such as TCP, IP, and UDP.

-We used Firebase as the database for storing the details of all the stocks, customer details, and banking details.

-The main focus of this project is to gain a clear understanding of the workings of base networking protocols, which are fundamental to networking.

-Implemented as a desktop application. The UI is done using PyQT. PyQT is relatively slow for running a desktop application, so you can experiment with Java instead if you aim for faster performance.

TO RUN:
-Run bankingserver, client, and server simultaneously in the same order on different devices connected to the same network, or run them in 3 different terminals.

-There are 3 different IP addresses to be provided, so make sure the correct IPs are used. To see the IPv4 address of your device, use ipconfig in Windows CMD and ifconfig on Linux machines.
